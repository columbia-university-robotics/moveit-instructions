# How to boot Ubuntu from flash drive
There are many options for installing Ubuntu on your computer: Native boot or dual-boot, Boot from USB flash drive, Virtual machines, Docker, etc.
In this tutorial we will learn how to boot from USB flash drive. This option is good because it does not alter your existing operating system.
(These instructions should work whether you have a PC or Mac.)

## Step 1: Gather materials

#### Step 1A: Buy a 128GB flash drive with fast read/write speeds
I bought the drive in [this link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BPK3XWW), but there are many others available at different price points. Make the USB you buy is at least a USB 3.0 and has at least 16GB capacity.

#### Step 1B: Get a 4GB USB stick
You should have a random flash drive lying around your house. You will need it!

#### Step 1C: Make sure you have at least two USB type A ports on your machine.
If not, you will need a [USB multiport hub](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Extended-MacBook-Surface-Notebook/dp/B07L32B9C2).

## Step 2: Download Ubuntu ISO file
Go to [Ubuntu Download Page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and get Ubuntu 20.04.

## Step 3: Write the ISO to the smaller (4GB) USB stick
Ignore step 3 if you have macOS. Instead, follow instructions on [this link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#3-prepare-the-usb-stick).

#### Step 3A: Download Rufus
Rufus is a free and open-source USB stick writing tool. I downloaded the portable version from [this link](https://rufus.ie/).

#### Step 3B: Plug in the 4GB USB to your computer

#### Step 3C: Open Rufus and select device
Click on the 4GB USB device from the “Device” field.

Click the select to the right of “Boot selection”. Select the appropriate ISO file and click on Open.

#### Step 3E: Write the ISO
Leave all other parameters with their default values and click start to initiate the write process.

#### Step 3F: Warnings
You may be alerted that Rufus requires additional files to complete writing the ISO. If this dialog box appears, select yes to continue.
You will then be alerted that Rufus has detected that the Ubuntu ISO is an ISOHybrid image. Keep Write in ISO Image mode selected and click on OK to continue.
Rufus will also warn you that all data on your selected USB device is about to be destroyed. This is a good moment to double check you’ve selected the correct device before clicking OK when you’re confident you have.

#### Step 3G: Installation complete
The ISO will now be written to your USB stick, and the progress bar in Rufus will give you some indication of where you are in the process.
When Rufus has finished writing the USB device, the Status bar will be green filled and the word READY will appear in the center. Select CLOSE to complete the write process.

## Step 4: Boot your machine from your newly written USB
Read your manufacturer’s instructions on how to boot from a USB.

#### Step 4A: Power off your computer and remove the 4GB USB.

#### Step 4B: Plug in your 4GB USB into your computer or into the USB hub again.

#### Step 4C: Power on your machine into the Boot Menu (by pressing F12 or volume down or whatever your manufacturer steps are).

#### Step 4D: Select the “boot from USB” option.
My Windows machine would display two options: one to “boot from USB” and another to “boot from ubuntu”. If this happens to you, choose the “boot from USB” option.

## Step 5: Try Ubuntu
Your machine should boot as Ubuntu OS on the 4GB USB.

#### Step 5A: Select the “Try Ubuntu” option.
The system will boot into the Ubuntu live desktop environment.

## Step 6: Partition your 128GB USB
We will now configure your 128GB USB to have a persistent storage space. This means that you can install software and edit code on it, and changes will be preserved each time you reboot.

#### Step 6A: While leaving your 4GB USB inserted, also insert your 128GB USB into the computer or USB hub.

#### Step 6B: From the left dock panel, click “show applications” and search for Gparted.

#### Step 6C: At the top-right of the GParted window, select your USB from the drop-down menu.
Pay attention to the drives and make sure you are selecting the 128GB flash drive (should be sdb).
